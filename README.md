# Data Science Portfolio Projects

### Project 1 - Predicting Donors' Income using supervised learning

**Description:** 

In this project, I employed several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. I then chose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. My goal with this implementation was to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000.

### Project 2 - Flower Image Classifier Application

**Description:** 

Going forward, AI algorithms will be incorporated into more and more everyday applications. For example, you might want to include an image classifier in a smart phone app. To do this, you'd use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications.

In this project, I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice one would train this classifier, then export it for use in application. We'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories

### Project 3 - Identifying Customers Segmentations

**Description:** 

In this project, I applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data that you will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.

First, the general demographics data are clustered through a KMeans clustering algorithms, then the same parameters are applied over the customer dataset to investigate if the customers are following the same distributions.

### Project 4 - Data Science Blog

**Description:** 

In this project, I analyzed the 2011 - 2018 Stack Overflow developer survey data in order to create a blog post regarding a comprehensive study of data science careers. The project notebook could be found below
